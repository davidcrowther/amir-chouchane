      <p class="clearfix with-icon"> <span class="pull-left icon-search-zoom"></span> Over the last 10 years I’ve worked in different companies in the Middle East, Asia and Africa and I’ve learned exactly what to do and what not to do to land a terrific job.</p>
      <p>You see, I’ve been on both sides of the job search process. I moved to Dubai and had to find a job fast or risk having to go back home defeated and embarrassed.</p>
      <p>I sent out literally hundreds of CVs and didn’t hear anything back. I failed numerous interviews. But I learned and I was able to land a human resources job at a well-known company.</p>
      <p>Now 10 years later my human resources work has given me a unique insight into the other side of the job hunt process. Now I am intimately familiar with what companies look for both in your CV-resume and in a job interview.</p> 
      <p>But I also still remember how difficult it was for me to land that first job. So with my extensive experience on both sides of the job search process, I’ve created a new resource … a simple, highly effective solution that solves all the difficulties of finding a great job in Dubai.</p>
      <p>That’s right, I have developed a complete blueprint that you can follow to find your dream job in record time. Just like with bodybuilding where you follow specific workouts to build specific muscles, with my system you follow certain steps to achieve certain results.</p>
      <p class="bigger">Instead of building muscle, with my system you’ll be securing interviews and job offers!</p>

      <h3>Let Me Pause Here to Introduce Myself …</h3>
      <p>Hello, my name is Amir Chouchane,and I’ve become an expert on finding employment in Dubai because I’ve spent years doing exactly that.</p>
      <p><span class="bigger">I’ve done the legwork and I’ve spent lots and lots of time figuring out how it all works.</span></p>
      <p>As I mentioned earlier I moved to Dubai and launched my own job search 10 years ago. I was young and eager and thought I would have no problem finding a good job. <span class="bigger">Of course, I couldn’t have been more wrong.</span></p>
      <p>While I thought I would make the perfect employee, it turns out I had a lot of trouble getting the hiring professionals to agree with me.</p>
      <p>My CVs didn’t generate call backs and the few interviews that I did land did not go well at all.</p>
      <p><span class="bigger">But as I failed again and again I began to notice things that I could do differently,</span> things that I could do better … and then after I was employed and gained more and more professional experience I came to understand what companies are really looking for.</p> 
      <p>Today, I stand before you as someone who knows what to emphasize and what to draw attention away from when searching for a job.</p>
      <p>I know how to make yourself irresistible to companies and I want <br /> to reveal all of this to you so you don’t have to go through all the <br /> stressful trial and error that I had to go through.</p>
      <p>But I’m not going to just share what I’ve learned, I’ve also <br /> compiled a top team of human resource professionals who <br /> have experience in a wide variety of areas and I’ve gotten <br /> them to reveal all of their secrets as well.</p>
      <p>I and my staff also interviewed current CEO’s, <br /> managers and entrepreneurs in Dubai while I wrote <br /> this book to ensure it is filled with the very latest <br /> tips and advice you need to know.</p>
      <p>I wrote it all down, taking care not to leave anything <br /> out, so that now you can get your hands on a <br /> <span class="orange">complete systematic and actionable approach <br /> that you can use to launch your career in Dubai … <br /> without making frustrating mistakes or having to <br /> go through costly trial and error.</span></p>

          <p>To be completely honest with you, the idea for this book came to me when my nephew approached me at a family reunion and mentioned that he was going to move to Dubai.</p>
          <p class="orange-color">He knew that I had done the same thing 10 years ago and he wanted to know if I had any advice.</p>
          <p>I told him that I would write a few things down and send them to him … and then before I knew it I had the beginnings of a book.</p>
          <p>Now you can get your hands on the very same time-saving job search secrets that I shared with my own flesh and blood.</p>
